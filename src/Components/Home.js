        I am currently 19 years old and I am an aspiring junior developer, I
        have developed my skills along side code nation, I first had an interest
        in their course when a family member showed me a ad in the local
        newspaper. I attended a 2019 develope course which lasted a total of
        three weeks long where I learn the basics of web design and app
        development, I enjoyed my time there and decided that I would like to
        attend the master course starting in 2020 which I am currently 7 weeks
        through.
